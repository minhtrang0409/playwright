/**
 * Let mergerdArray = []
    Method 01: 
    Loop over first array -> pussh all element intpu mergeArray
    Loop over 2 nd array then so the same as above
    Use bubblesort in the prev solution

WWhile 2 array still has values: fooIndex < fooLength && barIndex < barLength
if fooValue <= barValue
    push fooValue into mergeArray
    fooIndex++

else 
    pussh barValue into mergeArray

    Loop 1st array from fooIndex < fooLength => push all value into merger array
    Loop 2nd array from barIndex < barLength => push all value into merge array
